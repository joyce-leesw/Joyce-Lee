export const ABOUT = `I'm a software engineer based in *London*, currently working at *Post Op*, where I'm dedicated to making healthcare accessible to everyone, everywhere. My role involves designing intuitive mobile apps and occasionally developing web applications that help bring this vision to life.\n\nOutside of work, I dive into the fascinating world of AI, where I experiment with different machine learning models to unlock the potential of data.\n\nWhen I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me enjoying a game of chess, diving into a good book, or staying active with various sports.`;
